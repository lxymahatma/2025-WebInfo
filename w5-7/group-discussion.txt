Discussion Summary:
In an online quiz, we want to kick the user out if they change tabs or minimize the window to ensure fairness
What triggers the effect:
The component mounts, and we add an event listener for the visibilitychange event on the document
It triggers when the user switches tabs or minimizes the window

What visible output happens:
Initially, a quiz with questions and textboxes is displayed
If the tab is changed, the screen updates to:
“You have been kicked out for leaving the tab!”
The quiz content disappears immediately

Does it clean up? When/how?
Yes, the event listener is removed using removeEventListener in the cleanup function when the component unmounts

Why is this useful or interesting?
Helps monitor cheating or loss of focus in online exams
Encourages students to stay on the quiz tab
Great for apps that require strict attention (quizzes)
